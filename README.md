# Trolley Tracker - Web

Simple Django Webapp to display the information from the Code for Greenville Trolley Tracker API.  The webapp is designed to be brought into web pages as an iFrame, or viewed directly.  It also will bring in the current running schedules from the API if no routes are currently active.

@thedanfields created the original version of the API, and @bikeoid created the newer .NET API.
